## Arrays-and-Shortcuts
Allows the user to create a randomized number array of their chosen-size and sorts it, counting the swaps and comparisons.

## Language
C++

## Compiler Initially Used
Replit

## Information
A sorting program that allows the user to enter how large they'd like an array to be. The software then randomizes that amount of different numbers and gradually swaps them from lowest-to-highest. The program also counts and shows (each time) how many swaps and comparisons they did.

## Personal Information
A school project I had to do in order to understand how different swapping and organizing methods worked with using arrays.
